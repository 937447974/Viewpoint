                   Viewpoint for Exchange Web Services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program attempts to create a client access library for Exchange Web
Services (EWS) in Ruby.

!!!CAUTION!!!  This is currently BETA code and has changed dramatically from
the original version of Viewpoint which was based on Soap4r.  This version
has essentially been gutted and written on top of Handsoap.  Development
has been much more flexible, but the interface to Viewpoint has changed
quite a bit.  I have tried to write good code comments and I will keep
enhancing this.  I will also try and post examples on my blog as I write
them or they are asked for.
