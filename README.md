# Viewpoint for Exchange Web Services 1.0
http://github.com/zenchild/Viewpoint/wiki

Viewpoint for EWS provides a thin Ruby layer on top of Microsoft Exchange
Web Services(EWS). It also includes a bunch of model classes that add an
additional layer of abstraction on top of EWS for use in implementing
programs with Viewpoint.

# Features

## New in 1.0

* SOAP backend is now only dependant on Nokogiri. Before version 1.0 Viewpoint
went through a number of iterations in backends including SOAP4r and Handsoap.
Each of these approaches had major issues so in the end I decided it was
easiest to just build the SOAP messages with Nokogiri since I was using it as
the parser for response messages already.

* Viewpoint is no longer built on a Singleton pattern. The reason it was
previously is because of the Handsoap backend. Handsoap itself uses a
Singleton pattern for connection to the SOAP endpoint so with authentication
I was forced to implement Viewpoint as a Singleton as well. Now with Handsoap
out of the picture this is no longer required. Go crazy ;)

## Enhanced in 1.0

* *Delegate access is supported*
  One thing that was often asked for, but missing from the previous version
  was delegate access to mailboxes and calendars.  This is now supported via
  the 'act_as' parameter to the GenericFolder::get_folder method. For example:
  ofolder = Folder.get_folder(:inbox,'otheruser@test.com')
  If your user has delegate access to the Inbox for otheruser@test.com this
  operation will retrieve their inbox and allow you to manipulate it as you
  would with your own Inbox.

* There is also some support for manipulation of delegate access itself via
  the methods MailboxUser#add_delegate!, MailboxUser#update_delegate!, and 
  MailboxUser#get_delegate_info.


# Using Viewpoint

The version 1.0 API is quite a departure from the 0.1.x code base. If you have
a lot of legacy code and aren't suffering from performance issues, think twice
about upgrading. That said, I hope you'll find the new API much clean and more
intuitive than previous versions.

Note the `cli` variable in the setup code directly below. I will use that variable throughout without the setup code.

## The Setup
```ruby
require 'viewpoint'
include Viewpoint::EWS

endpoint = 'https://example.com/ews/Exchange.asmx'
user = 'username'
pass = 'password'

cli = Viewpoint::EWSClient.new endpoint, user, pass
```

There are also various options you can pass to EWSClient.

If you are testing in an environment using a self-signed certificate you can pass a connection parameter to ignore SSL verification by passing `http_opts: {ssl_verify_mode: 0}`.

If you want to target a specific version of Exchange you can pass `server_version: SOAP::ExchangeWebService::VERSION_2010_SP1`. You really shouldn't have to use this unless you know why.

## Accessors

There are some basic accessors available on the Viewpoint::EWSClient instance. In prior versions these were typically class methods off of the models themselves (ex: Folder.get_folder(id)). Now all accessors are available through EWSClient.

### Folder Accessors

#### Listing Folders
```ruby
# Find all folders under :msgfolderroot
folders = cli.folders

# Find all folders under Inbox
inbox_folders = cli.folders root: :inbox

# Find all folders under :root and do a Deep search
all_folders = cli.folders root: :root, traversal: :deep
```

#### Finding single folders
```ruby
folder = cli.get_folder <folder_id>
folder = cli.get_folder_by

TO USE:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'viewpoint'
include Viewpoint::EWS

endpoint = 'https://example.com/ews/Exchange.asmx'
user = 'username'
pass = 'password'

cli = Viewpoint::EWSClient.new endpoint, user, pass

# Get all folders
folders = cli.find_folders

# Get a specific folder
inbox = cli.get_folder :inbox

# Get available EWS methods on an object
inbox.ews_methods

# Get items from an object (messages in this case)
msgs = inbox.items
```
